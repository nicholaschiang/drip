# `drip`

The goal for this project is to make it easy to purchase any fit you see on
Instagram or TikTok or Facebook. It might be cool too to make it easy to
purchase any influencer's entire rotation. I should be able to catalog anyone's
wardrobe based on photos or videos of their fits.

I can start by picking a couple of my favorite stylists and then manually
finding their fits online. Hopefully, this'll lead to some type of algorithm I
can then automate for any account.

I suspect that algorithm may look something like this:
1. Look at the comments and see if anyone's asked where their fit is from. If
   they've responded, there we go. Now we just have to use those search terms
   to find purchase links.
2. Search by image to find similar items online. It'd be fantastic if we can
   search by image and take advantage of Google's indexing (e.g. I search by
   image for a unique t-shirt design and an image from the t-shirt e-commerce
   site pops up).
3. Compare that image with previously indexed images from the same influencer or
   influencers in similar spheres. I suspect that a lot of clothing items are
   commonly shared between people.

There are existing accounts that already do this for specific celebrities (e.g.
@finneasoutfits._). I should hit them up and ask how they go about it.

This idea could also go the other way around. Perhaps that may even lead to
better monetization: clothing companies can get a list of influencers that wear
their clothes and then feature them on their website as social validation.
